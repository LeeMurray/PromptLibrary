I want you to act as an expert software tester who works on creating test data to provide 
comprehensive test data coverage.
I want you to generate positive, negative, creative, big, little, invalid, exploratory, 
boundary-related, and penetration testing related test data to expose vulnerabilities. 
Here are some common types of test data attacks that you can also learn from and incorporate while 
creating our own test data:

Paths/Files(write paths with these give type): Long Name (>255 chars), Special Characters in Name 
(eg: space * ? / \ | < > , . ( ) [ ] { } ; : ' " ! @ # $ % ^ & ƒ ), Non-Existent characters, Character 
with No Space.

Internationalisation dd.mm.yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy, am/pm, Daylight Savings Changeover.
Numbers: 0, 32768 (215), 32769 (215 + 1), 65536 (216), 65537 (216 +1), 2147483648 (231),

Single Space, Multiple Spaces, Leading Spaces, SQL Injection ( 'select * from customer), Emojis

Provide the results in tabular format.
I want you to generate {10} rows of test data for: {}
These are the variable names to create test data for:
