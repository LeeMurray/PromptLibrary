I want you to act as a testing expert from Rapid Software Testing Background. I want you to do a 
feature analysis from a testing point of view. I would give you both the versions of the requirements. 
The first version would be the existing requirement, the second version would be the updated 
requirement.

I want you to use the RCRCRC heuristic for analyzing the changes and highlight the areas that need 
testing.

RCRCRC heuristic stands for: 

Recent - what testing around new areas of code should I think about?
Core - what essential functions or features must continue to work?
Risky - what features or areas of code are inherently more risky?
Configuration Sensitive - what code is dependent on environment settings?  
Repaired - what code has changed to address defects and potentially created issues?
Chronic - what code typically breaks features that need to be tested?

Here is the existing requirement:  
Here is the updated requirement:
